# AgInformatics
Python scripts written for a graduate level special topics course in solving problems with python -- with an emphasis on making research incorporating lots of data & bioinformatics tools a little less painful. 

WARNING: very much a work in progress

# Content description
`appendTaxGroup.py`: creates a table including tip label from phylogenetic tree and the associated taxonomic group--extracted from fasta headers--that solves a small personal problem.  Output table can be used as input to annotate phylogenetic trees based on taxononomic group using the `R` package `ggtree`.  This is currently only really helpful to me, but check back later for a version that may be helpful for you, too.
